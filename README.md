Your task is to build a responsive and user friendly signup form. The form should collect the following information from the user:

- **First name**
- **Last name**
- **Phone number**
- **Email address**
- **Password**
  - Minumum 8 characters, with atleast one uppercase letter, one number and one special character
- **Confirm password**
  - Has to match the password
- **Accepted terms & conditions**

Form sends this information to backend API `/sign-up`

The form should be able to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
